# Bug Hunt

## Instructions

This may appear to be a working piece of software with a few pending tests, but it turns out that we stopped testing right before we got to some major bugs!

Complete the pending tests to reveal the latent errors and then turn your failing tests into passing tests by fixing the code!

**Hint:** Each pending test is masking exactly 1 bug.
